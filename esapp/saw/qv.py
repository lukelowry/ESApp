        Write all QV analysis information to an auxiliary file.

        Saves the same information as ``QVWriteResultsAndOptions`` but uses
        the concise format for DATA section headers and variable names. Data
        is written using DATA sections instead of SUBDATA sections.

        This is a wrapper for the ``QVDataWriteOptionsAndResults`` script command.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            Name of the auxiliary file to save.
        append : bool, optional
            If True, appends results to existing file. If False, overwrites.
            Defaults to True.
        key_field : str, optional
            Identifier to use for data. "PRIMARY" uses bus numbers and primary
            key fields. "SECONDARY" uses bus name and nominal kV. "LABEL" uses
            device labels. Defaults to "PRIMARY".

        """
        Run a QV (Reactive Power-Voltage) analysis.

        Performs a QV study for buses whose QVSELECTED field is set to YES.
        QV analysis varies reactive power injection at monitored buses to
        determine voltage stability margins. The analysis produces QV curves
        showing the relationship between reactive power and voltage.

        This is a wrapper for the ``QVRun`` script command.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str, optional
            Path to a CSV file to save results. If None, a temporary file is
            used and results are returned as a DataFrame. Defaults to None.
        make_base_solvable : bool, optional
            If True, attempts to fix the base case if it is not solvable
            before running the QV analysis. Defaults to True.
        write_case_after_solve : bool, optional
            If True, writes the case file after each QV solve point.
            Defaults to False.

        Returns
        -------
        pandas.DataFrame or None
            If `filename` is None, returns a DataFrame containing the QV
            analysis results (voltage vs. reactive power for each bus).
            Otherwise, returns None.

        Raises
        ------

        Reduce monitored QV buses to one per pnode (super bus).

        When using QV analysis on a full topology model, this modifies the
        monitored buses so that only one bus is monitored for each pnode.
        This simplifies analysis and reduces computational load by focusing
        on representative buses.

        filter_name : str, optional
            Filter applied to QVCurve objects. Empty string selects all
