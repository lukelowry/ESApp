esapp.components: PowerWorld Component Definitions
===================================================

This module contains Python class definitions for PowerWorld Simulator objects
and Transient Stability field constants.

Contents:
    - ``grid``: GObject subclasses for all PowerWorld object types (Bus, Gen, Load, etc.)
    - ``ts_fields``: Transient Stability field constants for IDE intellisense (TS, TSField)
    - ``gobject``: Base GObject class and FieldPriority enum

Usage:
    >>> from esapp.components import Bus, Gen, Load, Branch
    >>> from esapp.components import TS, TSField

Note:
    grid.py and ts_fields.py are auto-generated by ``generate_components.py``
    using the PWRaw schema file. Do not edit these files directly.
